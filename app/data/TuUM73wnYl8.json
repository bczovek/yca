We were introduced to a lot of minor characters because just by introducing them it gives a certain excitement towards people who enjoy the Batman comics. I mean, some of the characters introduced are characters that haven't had a canon screen appearance in years. So for long time fans to be able to see that person in a film by DC, it gives a world of possibilities for other upcoming movies. It makes it so it is hard to guess what the next movie is going to be about, which excites people. \n3. People claim there were too many plots going on at once. And well, that's total bullshit. There was only really one plot: The Riddler thinks Batman is like him and wants to punish Gotham, but Batman isn't like him and saves Gotham instead. The only other possible thing that could be considered a plot was the whole romance between Selina and Batman, but once again that wasn't the focus of the film. Everything else in the movie was basically side quests you needed to take to get context on what the plot was. Anyone who missed this either wasn't paying attention to the movie or wasn't using critical thinking.", "authorDisplayName": "Feodora Wicked", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShX7bmWO_3wenUWmD5u96k9GSZO-LBfYlyVlHneQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUPfVBlNX3zu8_2Dkp6Goqw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUPfVBlNX3zu8_2Dkp6Goqw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-03-29T22:53:05Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-29T22:53:05Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "This kid is an amazing actor.

Batman asks about Riddler, and we see Joker has the ability to learn about a person from minimal information. \n\nAt the end he says that Batman thinks the victims had it coming. We don't get overt confirmation this is what Batman feels. It's established earlier that Joker has the ability to understand someone's psyche, so based on this it's very likely Batman thinks they got what they deserved.\n\nEdit:typo", "authorDisplayName": "Rakshasa", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSzZTH0ryTkgbIQIkbyvkR9OgSO8g7xpGkR3PjJ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQkTjy-Klqa2T-_uN_9cyA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkQkTjy-Klqa2T-_uN_9cyA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 21, "publishedAt": "2022-03-27T22:41:03Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-27T22:41:39Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "To be honest I feel like they purposely made this scene for the page as a reward", "textOriginal": "To be honest I feel like they purposely made this scene for the page as a reward", "authorDisplayName": "DeadopsGx", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/C4F97UvgOT9zUE9g-Wd0hZE1fLQD0KvbFnXdt5QkkrIkG3bYSRv9iKG0q2qplzLnEJfZhb-ViZ8=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lca9QsFRklVVwu56HMRmA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-lca9QsFRklVVwu56HMRmA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-03-27T22:15:34Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-27T22:15:34Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "The makeup for Joker\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen a Joker\u2019s smile more disgusting than this\u2026", "textOriginal": "The makeup for Joker\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen a Joker\u2019s smile more disgusting than this\u2026", "authorDisplayName": "Attakrus", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/_hAJ4vA00uB3ct3c6JZiO7dmX_h_jq2AvKnEp1SVXFfcvfsfD_lJgaVBPGggBocvblG5sQv0=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbdR7WtlV8KbaRYGZOgb2cw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCbdR7WtlV8KbaRYGZOgb2cw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2022-03-27T22:00:06Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-27T22:00:06Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "Can someone please caption this i cant understand what he says in the beginning lol", "textOriginal": "Can someone please caption this i cant understand what he says in the beginning lol", "authorDisplayName": "Jonathan Pacheco", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTnZtnbgYU5Q0wMSxu6NIlDbD3vUJk2QlwjDwVjaw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8lZYkv3bEZI7wyDGnbVSw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCF8lZYkv3bEZI7wyDGnbVSw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-03-27T21:48:44Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-27T21:48:44Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "am i the only one that already hates barry keoghan as joker", "textOriginal": "am i the only one that already hates barry keoghan as joker", "authorDisplayName": "RICH", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/hSDJdD6vSdaBx13hu1CiruFEKQVKXDt0aCVAHzRnutgSTzSbyiK9yoNR-4ExSJWw7Cp9NAFqbA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN6dATA8Tefn4PzbcSUifhA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCN6dATA8Tefn4PzbcSUifhA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-03-27T21:46:40Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-27T21:46:40Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "I&#39;m so tired of seeing the Joker.

The Joker gives Batman strong advice on who the Riddler is and therefore he is effectively being given the answers rather than working it out for himself like he does in the theatrical cut.<br><br>I understand why people are saying that the Joker has been portrayed enough in films and that they should be giving other villains a chance, but the Joker is Batman&#39;s arch-enemy and it would be remiss of them not to include him in any future films in this Batman Universe.<br><br>This take on the Joker looks creepy as hell and is a crazed mixture of psychotic and pure genius. I feel he is still a fresh enough take on the character from just this one scene to have him involved against this Batman at some point.

His father, Thomas Wayne, is who created these insane people, with funding unorthodox experiments on mentally disturbed people, making them worse. Batman is thus, a creation of his father's unethical practices, and consequent actions of his inability to get over his parents death. What people like the Joker and Riddler know, is that the real Batman is hiding within his darkness, shadows, each of them attempting to release that darkness to convert him. Batman is a vigilante, using violence to settle scores with an underworld even Thomas Wayne was a part of with figures like Don Falcone. Each Joker character gives us greater insight. But this Batman is by far the best in honing in on the dark of Batman, Gotham in general, and all the characters calling it home. Batman in general, is the most compelling of all of comic book characters.  I can't wait to see this version. It's more authentic and realistic, dark and edgy, with all of the lineup more compellingly portrayed.", "authorDisplayName": "SOVEREIGN", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTzXqP0WoV0nDby1QTanguDkMzNKxtYwmkuNyrPLuBSOzNe1BB1Hd_yG8yLwfHb=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG9zW3-7_V2YYsOILyQaiRA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCG9zW3-7_V2YYsOILyQaiRA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-03-24T22:14:37Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-24T22:14:37Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "The riddlers arkham scene was better, but I am intrigued", "textOriginal": "The riddlers arkham scene was better, but I am intrigued", "authorDisplayName": "Flipitmixit", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTo35JkGnciP2Fj2o_Tn7nntmfhMLY-bwGviRUUByzPyDopiycgRLyWvD-oh_TB=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgrn-vTHS-GuqY6Lvgl_Ucg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgrn-vTHS-GuqY6Lvgl_Ucg"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-03-24T22:14:29Z", "updatedAt": "2022-03-24T22:14:29Z"}, {"videoId": "TuUM73wnYl8", "textDisplay": "This is a perfect Joker, taken right from the comics.
