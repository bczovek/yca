There is unbelievable level of duplicity and violation of journalistic standards in the way NYT is covering the conflict which was started by a rebel force intent on overthrowing a democratic government. There is another Libya in the making orchestrated by Biden admin and media companies like NYT. Only someone like you can uncover the duplicity in a 20 minute segment.",

While fossil fuel plants can be built anywhere, the fuel does not just appear magically on their doorstep. The system for bringing the energy to them is even more onerous than for electricity. Either it has to come via pipeline or truck, and this infrastructure has even more issues than power lines. By omitting this fact, you leave a false impression of a difficulty for renewables that fossil fuels does not have.",

Canada and Mexico might also be good investments for energy trade helping neighbors set up grids and trade back and forth depending on need. I really want John to do a piece on animal shelters, especially government run and police departments, for poor conditions and lack of funding\/motivation for programs reducing euthanasia rates and more importantly increase quality of life for the animals they are there to protect(otherwise they are less shelters and more prisons). That issue is close to me and I feel would help people care for animals as more than property. Early laws were only to help reduce cattle and horse losses in transit and quickly turned around to favor children being mistreated as property giving them rights while animals were put off for another time. We do not need domestic animals to live, but humans did domesticate them from nature for profit and equated that to survival for ourselves over the products well being. Most of the time people do take care of their pets and that helps the fatigue, but they are still considered inferior to humans making management focus on what is best for people(money and dogs not biting) and not the animals(positive reinforcment and low stress environments). Please look into compassion fatigue\/burnout for volunteers and employees, mismanagement, TNR programs, jurisdictions lacking funding, transparency, and the necessity of certified behaviorists and trainers teaching employees and volunteers about proper animal care with positive reinforcment. Sorry for the virtue signaling and guilt over current aninal welfare, but save rates do not make a shelter &quot;good&quot; when they discriminate breeds and behaviors that all can be managed with more resources like rescues, community outreach, donations\/better funding(the city shelter I worked at was last on the Public Works funding list puttin the human prisons first and aninal prisons last), and education from professionals, not just the few employees who uncertified managers trained or went to one introductory behavior\/training course.

All upgrading our power grid will do is kick the problem down the line another 100 years and keep the the energy moguls profiting. We need small scale micro power plants to augment our existing system. The only reason upgrading our power lines will be expensive to fix is because they are trying to convince the people to pay for replacing their profit machines. We can just fix the mechanical issues with our existing power grids if their power load being drawn off them is massively reduced by strategic small scale green power systems within cities and neighborhoods. We need to create redundancy while upgrading the safety of our existing grid. Much of the issues with the old grid is that we are over drawing on those lines. Line loss is directly current dependent. The power you draw at a constant voltage the more current you draw. And we\u2019ve approached the limits of our thickness of line for the power being drawn\/current draw. We still will need the grid to help smooth out supply but if people\u2019s power is coming from near them and not being sent to them the lines don\u2019t need to be upgraded. Stop letting the energy monopolies convince the American people to pay for these mega corps profit machines. Help the actual people not need to rely on those centralized systems.

  "textOriginal":"The problem is centralized electricity systems. The solution is not \u201cmake more centralized electricity systems\u201d. We need autonomy for individual users. All upgrading our power grid will do is kick the problem down the line another 100 years and keep the the energy moguls profiting. We need small scale micro power plants to augment our existing system. The only reason upgrading our power lines will be expensive to fix is because they are trying to convince the people to pay for replacing their profit machines. We can just fix the mechanical issues with our existing power grids if their power load being drawn off them is massively reduced by strategic small scale green power systems within cities and neighborhoods. We need to create redundancy while upgrading the safety of our existing grid. Much of the issues with the old grid is that we are over drawing on those lines. Line loss is directly current dependent. The power you draw at a constant voltage the more current you draw. And we\u2019ve approached the limits of our thickness of line for the power being drawn\/current draw. We still will need the grid to help smooth out supply but if people\u2019s power is coming from near them and not being sent to them the lines don\u2019t need to be upgraded. Stop letting the energy monopolies convince the American people to pay for these mega corps profit machines. Help the actual people not need to rely on those centralized systems. Otherwise we are just being duped with another get rich scheme by these energy corporations.",
