  "textDisplay":"This is the most disappointing episode of Last Week Tonight I&#39;ve ever seen. Typically John will also at least briefly cover the alternative perspective and potential negative factors and hidden issues you encounter when you stop looking at something on face value. He doesn&#39;t here whatsover. This video is basically just pro-union propaganda (as if it couldn&#39;t be wrong) and barely researched. The reason for the decline in union membership is NOT because of union busting. It&#39;s because people (workers) lost faith in unions and the need for them, primarily because many unions weren&#39;t pulling their weight. Instead, many unions&#39; primary purpose became preserving their own existence, not being advocates for the workers. There is a reason unionizing is almost always a last resort (certainly never not first resort) for workers. Unions are not created equal, and for every good one, there are 3 shitty ones.  Many are just sales oriented and predatory to the point where instead of being advocates they are simply unnecessary middlemen looking for a cut.  People overwhelming support the ability to have a union if it becomes necessary, but the majority of these people also do not actually want to join a union. Take a look at the pay of union executives often being more than that of executives of the company, yet these unions are non profit? That data on union jobs paying more is also exaggerated. One, that&#39;s not true across the board for all job types, and, two, those studies are apples-to-apples only and took no other factors into account that can also explain wage differences (notably job tenure as, admittedly, union jobs typically do have more tenured employees, as well as city jobs naturally paying more than smaller area\/rural jobs and unions being more likely to exist in cities where the pay is already naturally higher).  And regarding companies trying to deter unions, why wouldn&#39;t they when it directly cancels their ability to make their own decisions within their company? There is an infamous history of unions decades ago of being involved with crime, and why wouldn&#39;t that be the case since unionizing itself is not that different from extortion in the first place? And let&#39;s not forget the PRO act, which also eliminates right to work laws. There is massive misinformation that right to work laws prevent unions, which is not the case whatsover. What right to work laws do is prevent non-union workers from being forced to pay unions fees. Right to work laws close a LOOPHOLE in the system where otherwise these unions force everyone to pay and effectively create a &quot;closed shop&quot; workplace, which is illegal nationwide. Unions want that loophole, and unions want those closed shop workplaces. Also, how about looking into the difficulty workers face when trying to de-unionize their workplace from these shitty unions  (how long it takes, the orchestrated delays, and policies preventing it.)<br><br><br>Simply Google union horror stories, and you will find countless examples of workers themselves describing how bad these unions are and how little they did for them. My first job was in a union workplace. It was a grocery chain associated with UFCW, one of the largest unions in the nation. Every employee there started at minimum wage. You would then get nickel and dime raises each year, until.... you hit the wage cap for your position, which was only about $2 more than minimum wage. This is what the fancy UFCW contract got you. But that&#39;s not all thought; most of the workers are intentionally kept part-time, meaning they lose about 10% of their pay to the union since it is a flat amount. A lot of the part-time workers are also students getting their first job. They are under 18 (unlikely to keep that job as a career) and have even more restrictions on how many hours they can work during the week (about 15 max during the school year). Does that stop these unions from being predatory towards these kids as well? Nope. The union rep (AKA salesman who isn&#39;t one of your fellow employees and works soley for the union) is there every week trying to sign up any new hires. I literally once saw this union salesman directly take a new employee who just signed their new hire paperwork paperwork 30 seconds ago into a &quot;join our union&quot; meeting. This kid hasn&#39;t even started training or have their name tag, yet the are already being preyed upon by this union rep. Let&#39;s also not forget that police unions are the pinnacle fantasy of what every union dreams to be, and we all know they extreme issues police unions cause. Oh, and then there&#39;s one last great thing the union did for this company. As the company was going into bankruptcy and closing a series of stores each year (until they eventually closed them all), if your store was closing and you had more union seniority than another union member at another location for the same position, you could take their job if you were willing to move there (which was often just a neighboring city, so many did).",
  "textOriginal":"This is the most disappointing episode of Last Week Tonight I've ever seen. Typically John will also at least briefly cover the alternative perspective and potential negative factors and hidden issues you encounter when you stop looking at something on face value. He doesn't here whatsover. This video is basically just pro-union propaganda (as if it couldn't be wrong) and barely researched. The reason for the decline in union membership is NOT because of union busting. It's because people (workers) lost faith in unions and the need for them, primarily because many unions weren't pulling their weight. Instead, many unions' primary purpose became preserving their own existence, not being advocates for the workers. There is a reason unionizing is almost always a last resort (certainly never not first resort) for workers. Unions are not created equal, and for every good one, there are 3 shitty ones.  Many are just sales oriented and predatory to the point where instead of being advocates they are simply unnecessary middlemen looking for a cut.  People overwhelming support the ability to have a union if it becomes necessary, but the majority of these people also do not actually want to join a union. Take a look at the pay of union executives often being more than that of executives of the company, yet these unions are non profit? That data on union jobs paying more is also exaggerated. One, that's not true across the board for all job types, and, two, those studies are apples-to-apples only and took no other factors into account that can also explain wage differences (notably job tenure as, admittedly, union jobs typically do have more tenured employees, as well as city jobs naturally paying more than smaller area\/rural jobs and unions being more likely to exist in cities where the pay is already naturally higher).  And regarding companies trying to deter unions, why wouldn't they when it directly cancels their ability to make their own decisions within their company? There is an infamous history of unions decades ago of being involved with crime, and why wouldn't that be the case since unionizing itself is not that different from extortion in the first place? And let's not forget the PRO act, which also eliminates right to work laws. There is massive misinformation that right to work laws prevent unions, which is not the case whatsover. What right to work laws do is prevent non-union workers from being forced to pay unions fees. Right to work laws close a LOOPHOLE in the system where otherwise these unions force everyone to pay and effectively create a \"closed shop\" workplace, which is illegal nationwide. Unions want that loophole, and unions want those closed shop workplaces. Also, how about looking into the difficulty workers face when trying to de-unionize their workplace from these shitty unions  (how long it takes, the orchestrated delays, and policies preventing it.)\n\n\nSimply Google union horror stories, and you will find countless examples of workers themselves describing how bad these unions are and how little they did for them. My first job was in a union workplace. It was a grocery chain associated with UFCW, one of the largest unions in the nation. Every employee there started at minimum wage. You would then get nickel and dime raises each year, until.... you hit the wage cap for your position, which was only about $2 more than minimum wage. This is what the fancy UFCW contract got you. But that's not all thought; most of the workers are intentionally kept part-time, meaning they lose about 10% of their pay to the union since it is a flat amount. A lot of the part-time workers are also students getting their first job. They are under 18 (unlikely to keep that job as a career) and have even more restrictions on how many hours they can work during the week (about 15 max during the school year). Does that stop these unions from being predatory towards these kids as well? Nope. The union rep (AKA salesman who isn't one of your fellow employees and works soley for the union) is there every week trying to sign up any new hires. I literally once saw this union salesman directly take a new employee who just signed their new hire paperwork paperwork 30 seconds ago into a \"join our union\" meeting. This kid hasn't even started training or have their name tag, yet the are already being preyed upon by this union rep. Let's also not forget that police unions are the pinnacle fantasy of what every union dreams to be, and we all know they extreme issues police unions cause. Oh, and then there's one last great thing the union did for this company. As the company was going into bankruptcy and closing a series of stores each year (until they eventually closed them all), if your store was closing and you had more union seniority than another union member at another location for the same position, you could take their job if you were willing to move there (which was often just a neighboring city, so many did).",

Any law that hurts the majority of business&#39; bottom line, will never pass because of lobbying. A business that is willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on keeping Unions out, wouldn&#39;t bat an eye at a couple of millions to grease the wheels to keep a law from passing.<br><br>I used to work for Walmart. While I was there, there was rumblings of a Union at that store. So all of the managers started talking about all the negatives of a Union. Not in captive meetings, just on the floor in casual conversation while stocking with the grunts. An attempt to sew dissent among the grunts by doing their job with them, showing they are just like you, and casually commenting on how a Union would hurt the store. Sad to say, it worked.<br><br>I was later fired from that Walmart, on what I found out later in a class action lawsuit were trumped up reasons. The class action lawsuit was because they had fired several others for some of the same reasons. Poor attendance, poor performance, not meeting &#39;quota&#39;. Things like that. We won that, and I got $35 and the manager that was doing all the firing was herself fired. Woo. I was later called by my old floor manager and told that if I wanted to reapply, they would welcome me back as they were hurting for staff. Especially on the overnight crew(which is where I was originally). That Walmart that was once a 24 hour super center, is now a regular non-24 hour Walmart. I told them to f--- off I had found a better job, which I suspect many others did as well.<br><br>And all the people who plan to comment &quot;Boo Amazon!

  "textOriginal":"10:10 \"That contract finally might include less wages and less benefits.\" Told to a worker already making the current minimum wage and can't go any lower.\n\n19:48 \"But until that law is passed, and it should pass.\" But it won't. Any law that hurts the majority of business' bottom line, will never pass because of lobbying. A business that is willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on keeping Unions out, wouldn't bat an eye at a couple of millions to grease the wheels to keep a law from passing.\n\nI used to work for Walmart. While I was there, there was rumblings of a Union at that store. So all of the managers started talking about all the negatives of a Union. Not in captive meetings, just on the floor in casual conversation while stocking with the grunts. An attempt to sew dissent among the grunts by doing their job with them, showing they are just like you, and casually commenting on how a Union would hurt the store. Sad to say, it worked.\n\nI was later fired from that Walmart, on what I found out later in a class action lawsuit were trumped up reasons. The class action lawsuit was because they had fired several others for some of the same reasons. Poor attendance, poor performance, not meeting 'quota'. Things like that. We won that, and I got $35 and the manager that was doing all the firing was herself fired. Woo. I was later called by my old floor manager and told that if I wanted to reapply, they would welcome me back as they were hurting for staff. Especially on the overnight crew(which is where I was originally). That Walmart that was once a 24 hour super center, is now a regular non-24 hour Walmart. I told them to f--- off I had found a better job, which I suspect many others did as well.\n\nAnd all the people who plan to comment \"Boo Amazon! Vote with your wallet!\" and \"Boo Walmart! Vote with your wallet!\" Please, you don't believe that any more than I do. These companies can get away with what they are doing because those are hollow words. Tomorrow you will wake up and go right back to normal, buying that cute sweater from Amazon and tonight's ham from Walmart. These companies can practically get away with murder because they provide a convenience.

They told us the benefits of having a union and there were dues but they werent bad. Basically the good was waaay better then the bad. My dad was a manager so they trusted me to go to the meeting and write down the employees that showed up and was told that they would be fired and they would come up with some type of reason. The upper management just snickered and laughed. Long story short. I went to the meeting and never took down a single name. Why would I? The union was a good thing. Well once the employees came in the next day, the upper management told employees that they found out a union meeting took place and that if they signed up then the company would shut down or be forced to lay off a bunch of employees. The company is still open to this day and I really wish the employees that felt threatened just stayed the course. Right now is the perfect time to organize. Companies need workers and the employees have an upper hand. My whole family and friends are  in unions  and you cant compete with the benefits they receive. Employers have had the ability to work people to deaath and now the tables have turned. Please please please consider getting one.. Dont let employers change your mind.. Sorry soo much typing lol",

That's why Mr. Oliver had to lie his ass off to defend them.\n\n\"A two-to-one vote SEEMS like a clear-cut case to reject unions, but.....\"\r\n\nMeanwhile, \"union-busting\" generally means that a company will point out how many unions bankrupt the company they're feeding on and screw over their workers.  How evil, I tell ya....\r\n\nIt's cute that unions have to have union dues to fight for their members--definitely not so they can donate tens of millions of dollars to political parties that generally think their workers are a bunch of racist homophobic transphobic etc., etc., etc., or to pay the union bosses half a million a year.....\n\n(Also, speaking of Mr. Oliver lying his ass off--it is important that the Union is in it for the money, because they claim not to be.  More, that wasn't the company's argument; it's that the Union doesn't give anything in return for its money.\n\nAnd if he can't tell the difference between going bankrupt and deliberately closing down a factory to piss off the union...  well, yeah, he knows the difference.  He's lying.  \n\nAnd why is \"Detroit\" such a threat?  Unions are exactly what happened to Detroit.\n\nThe amusing part is that Amazon and Starbucks are explicitly liberal companies--they just don't want to commit suicide.",

We were issued handheld digital multimeters that require a calibration certification every year down on the unionized production floor. I received notification that mine was due for calibration so I took it down to the Cal Lab. Two days later I was notified by my boss that a grievance had been filed against me because I did not use a &quot;material handler&quot; (a union member whose only job is to push around a large pushcart for moving things) to transport my 1\/2 pound multimeter to the Cal Lab.<br>2. We had to get 576 transmitter modules (~5 lbs each) removed from a test bed, boxed in custom boxes, then all placed in a couple of palletized tri-wall containers. A sailor pulling all the modules would take about three hours to remove them from the transmitter units. Placing them in the boxes takes about 30 seconds per module. Putting those boxes in the tri-wall takes all of 5 seconds each. 3 hours to pull the modules + 4.8 hours for putting them in boxes + 48 minutes to put the boxes in the tri-walls. One person could realistically do it in 8.6 hours. Because these were a rush order, GE tasked two IBEW members to get them in the tri-walls on a Saturday (at the time and a half wage rate). These TWO IBEW members charged 8 hours on Saturday AND 8 hours on Sunday (at the double time wage rate) to complete the work. They charged 32 manhours to perform a task that should only have taken 9 manhours.<br>3. This one might or might not be union generated... For a brief time I was loaned to the production floor to assist with assembling some TTL circuit cards. At lunch I was notified by the foreman that I was working too fast - mainly because I wasn&#39;t taking the union-mandated breaks during the shift. I guess they have designated break points for smoking\/drink\/potty time. The foreman was concerned my completion rate was going to make the &quot;regular&quot; production floor employees look bad. &quot;Whatever.&quot; I just took a bunch of coke breaks spaced out through the rest of the day.",

Obviously, directly benefits, themselves. They receive, paychecks, whether the actually work or not.They, vote to give themselves raises, they get most, of their living expenses, paid for.

Loaders are treated like the worst piece of garbage and easily replaced for a job that starts at 2am to 4am but they are always hiring and often can&#39;t fill positions.  Also , you need to be wrapped by 9 am so by the end of the week its usually a $280 pay check ( that will take care of the bills).The supervisors ( who are not union and have to pay for healthcare) go out of there way to make the work place as horrific possible.  The expectation is to load 3 to 4 vehicles with 300 plus packages with no mistakes or your job is on the line. I do recognize the value that is offered but have never worked in such an environment for the disdain of its people. Maybe unions are better than the alternative but not by much in my experience. <br>Note: I am also self employed and have also had years managing large amounts of people. This was a unique experience for me that I stuck out for 2 years as an experiment and cause ...you know...free health care!!",

Loaders are treated like the worst piece of garbage and easily replaced for a job that starts at 2am to 4am but they are always hiring and often can't fill positions.  Also , you need to be wrapped by 9 am so by the end of the week its usually a $280 pay check ( that will take care of the bills).The supervisors ( who are not union and have to pay for healthcare) go out of there way to make the work place as horrific possible.  The expectation is to load 3 to 4 vehicles with 300 plus packages with no mistakes or your job is on the line. I do recognize the value that is offered but have never worked in such an environment for the disdain of its people. Maybe unions are better than the alternative but not by much in my experience. \nNote: I am also self employed and have also had years managing large amounts of people. This was a unique experience for me that I stuck out for 2 years as an experiment and cause ...you know...free health care!!",

They also only paid into the fund at a rate of 40 hours a week, because thats when you stopped benefitting. like literally the best position in the field became to work within the union hall. you made more money, did less work, and got all the benefits as though you were the one out there busting your ass.",

  "textDisplay":"At my bfs last job which was industrial cleaning in a tobacco plant so NOT easy labor whatsoever, during covid they worked their employees months at a time, just to the legal limit with one day off so that they were technically not breaking any laws, and they weren&#39;t told beforehand that they would be working each weekend as &quot;mandatory overtime&quot;, they were told each week on Thursday or Friday that they had to come in. Every week, for months. If you called out, you either had to use your PTO which was around 3 workdays total, or get points which most people ended up having to do. at one point when several people had something going on and were protesting to their boss, they were told and I quote, &quot;well don&#39;t make plans on a weekend because you never know when they&#39;ll need you to come in&quot;. I have supreme respect for my boyfriend for not decking that pompous buttbooger upside the head and walking out right then. He finally did quit when they put him with a partner that refused to train him, and yelled at him when he messed up to the point that the real employees (my bf was contracted) were complaining, which was the kind of thing that never happens there, since the direct hires are above the contractors on the totem pole so to speak and they don&#39;t care. They refused to move him or deal with that employee, and after the meeting with his supervisors he was going back to work, and she started in again because she knew why he was in there, and she was screaming at him in the middle of the breakroom.

  "textOriginal":"At my bfs last job which was industrial cleaning in a tobacco plant so NOT easy labor whatsoever, during covid they worked their employees months at a time, just to the legal limit with one day off so that they were technically not breaking any laws, and they weren't told beforehand that they would be working each weekend as \"mandatory overtime\", they were told each week on Thursday or Friday that they had to come in. Every week, for months. If you called out, you either had to use your PTO which was around 3 workdays total, or get points which most people ended up having to do. at one point when several people had something going on and were protesting to their boss, they were told and I quote, \"well don't make plans on a weekend because you never know when they'll need you to come in\". I have supreme respect for my boyfriend for not decking that pompous buttbooger upside the head and walking out right then.

Worst thing is that firefighters and police frequently visit the hospitals to drop off patients or in the case of police, sit in the corner of an inpatient inmate and watch you work all night while they watch movies on Netflix on their phones or computers. This drives me insane.",

  "textDisplay":"I had a union retail job when I was younger and the company was constantly trying to step over the line established by the union contract. My union dues were less than one hours pay a week and it was well worth it, plenty of my friends worked at similar stores that were not unionized and it was very clear that I was in a better situation than they were. I was paid more for having the exact same job as my friends, there was no mandatory overtime, my schedule could not be changed once it was put up for the week (no surprises), I was paid for holidays as well as having sick and personal days which my friends did not, I was never asked to work through lunch or a break. My supervisor came into the break room one time and wanted to start talking about what we were going to do after break,he did not like it when I said-not for nothing,I&#39;m on a break and this is my time,I&#39;m not on the clock,I don&#39;t want to think about work until I clock back in.He was especially unhappy because there were over 25 employees in the room paying attention to what was being said because he knew I was absolutely correct. When he started saying that he understood but it was very important that we got a jump on the rest of the day,I told him this is starting to seem like something I should talk to the union rep about he shot me a look that could melt ice then left the room. Who do you think was lifting the heaviest things in the store for the rest of the day? Of course it wasn&#39;t the two big dudes that were doing it all morning, you guessed it, it was me and the girl sitting next to me in the break room. This was a man who was promoted to management less than a month before when he was a union member I couldn&#39;t blame him for taking the money,I did blame him for drinking the Kool-Aid and changing overnight into an asshole that went out of his way to be an asshole. He definitely acted different, you would have thought he was an admiral in the Navy in charge of a fleet of aircraft carriers instead of a shift manager at a retail chain. My father was the secretary of the union at the Philadelphia mint when he retired and became a teacher in the Philadelphia public school system is union reputation followed him.His 1st day as a teacher he was approached by the union that wanted him to be active in the teachers union as fast as possible and he immediately became an intricate part of the teachers union. My father represented all the substitute teachers in the Philadelphia public school system on the executive board and eventually became his schools building rep. He was part of the delegation representing Phila. at teachers conferences across the nation many times. When my father died his viewing went much longer than we planned, there were way more people there than we expected. A surprising amount of his coworkers from the mint were there lots of them remembered how my father helped to save their jobs. There were hundreds of teachers as well as non-union school district employees like principles etc. there that night with great things to say as well. All of his students and a surprisingly large amount of his older students who still remember the affect he had on their lives were there also. The students were there because he was a great teacher who cared as well as taught, The coworkers (lots of these coworkers had been retired for years at this point) were there because he was a great guy to work with and because of how he stood up for all of them . It was overwhelming, me and my mom did not expect it to go so long,but it did feel good seeing that my dad did more with his life than I thought he did.<br>Don&#39;t believe anti-union propaganda!

The USPS has no shortage of unscrupulous and unqualified managers who would have loved nothing more than to fire employees for the most trivial of reasons. It sucked for the good employees, though.

  "textOriginal":"I was on the other side of the table; a USPS management rep. The APWU was\/is a... decent union but, during my tenure, took some decidedly shady positions. Protecting the worst employees from disciplinary action or outright removal, for instance. In one case I personally know of, they brought back a sex offender who'd been brought up on federal charges - in direct violation of their contract and USPS regs, and got him back pay for all the time he was off the clock during the investigation and while his trial was ongoing. \nWith that said, the APWU was better than no union at all.

Anyone who thinks that all that union busting mis information is for the good of the workers is either dilusional or, more often and much worse, a boot licker.",
