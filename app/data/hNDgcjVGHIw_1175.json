  "textDisplay":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hNDgcjVGHIw&amp;t=3m40s\">3:40<\/a> This \u2018article\u2019 is asinine. Its cites liberal states and decries them without considering the rest of the country. Sure, building in California has slowed down\u2026 but you know where else it has slowed down? EVERYWHERE!!! There is not a state where construction has not slowed down.<br>\r<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hNDgcjVGHIw&amp;t=4m40s\">4:40<\/a> The notion that higher density buildings are somehow supposed to be more progressive is patently absurd. In fact, the more this video continues, the more it seems like a typical conservative diatribe of reasons why we need to squeeze more people into high-density apartments. This isn\u2019t a progressive argument\u2026 its pro-corporatist\u2026 after all, corporations typically own big apartment complexes. \r<br>\r<br>While, yes, it is possible to lower the cost of units by cramming them all together, this isn\u2019t helpful for addressing the rampant out-of-control real-estate prices caused by corporations buying up properties in order to force an artificial scarcity. The answer here is to force those companies and individuals who are sitting on numerous investment properties to divest of them\u2026 not force people to live in smaller and more cramped apartments. \r<br>\r<br>Since 2007, well over 4 million houses have been removed from the real-estate market in order to serve as Airbnb houses. That\u2019s 4 million houses that SHOULD be on the real estate market that are not. Simply limiting the number of Airbnb houses one person may own would have a tremendous impact on available real estate. Another measure which would go a long way would be to prohibit out-of-state purchases which do not include an intent to move into the state within 60 days\u2026 and a prohibition on purchases outside the US entirely.\r<br>\r<br>Single-family houses are not the problem\u2026 full-stop.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hNDgcjVGHIw&amp;t=7m40s\">7:40<\/a> \u2013 This video is correct that Washington State has one of the most regressive tax systems in the US. What this video fails to address is the OVERWHELMING amounts of money that Amazon and Microsoft have put into influencing elections in that state\u2026 including vigorously attacking any and all forms of a wealth tax, which would allow the state to shift away from its regressive tax system. \r<br>\r<br>Its strange that this video is quick to identify a cause for real estate issues in California (even if they\u2019re fundamentally wrong), but oddly omits anything resembling a cause for Washington\u2019s regressive taxes.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hNDgcjVGHIw&amp;t=9m40s\">9:40<\/a> \u2013 Most of the district disparity in Illinois comes from heavy gerrymandering prior to becoming a Democratic majority. Add to that, there is still a powerfully strong lobbying force that keeps minorities in poorer schools and conservatives in the better funded schools. Again, no consideration of the underlying cause of the problem.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hNDgcjVGHIw&amp;t=11m20s\">11:20<\/a> \u2013 So, the game plan here is to just paint each state as entirely one monolithic political group without any sort of nuance whatsoever? No actual delving into any real underlying causes? No consideration of how the opposition parties may or may not have been an undermining impact in each state?

  "textOriginal":"3:40 This \u2018article\u2019 is asinine. Its cites liberal states and decries them without considering the rest of the country. Sure, building in California has slowed down\u2026 but you know where else it has slowed down? EVERYWHERE!!! There is not a state where construction has not slowed down.\n\r\n4:40 The notion that higher density buildings are somehow supposed to be more progressive is patently absurd. In fact, the more this video continues, the more it seems like a typical conservative diatribe of reasons why we need to squeeze more people into high-density apartments. This isn\u2019t a progressive argument\u2026 its pro-corporatist\u2026 after all, corporations typically own big apartment complexes. \r\n\r\nWhile, yes, it is possible to lower the cost of units by cramming them all together, this isn\u2019t helpful for addressing the rampant out-of-control real-estate prices caused by corporations buying up properties in order to force an artificial scarcity. The answer here is to force those companies and individuals who are sitting on numerous investment properties to divest of them\u2026 not force people to live in smaller and more cramped apartments. \r\n\r\nSince 2007, well over 4 million houses have been removed from the real-estate market in order to serve as Airbnb houses. That\u2019s 4 million houses that SHOULD be on the real estate market that are not. Simply limiting the number of Airbnb houses one person may own would have a tremendous impact on available real estate. Another measure which would go a long way would be to prohibit out-of-state purchases which do not include an intent to move into the state within 60 days\u2026 and a prohibition on purchases outside the US entirely.\r\n\r\nSingle-family houses are not the problem\u2026 full-stop.\r\n\r\n7:40 \u2013 This video is correct that Washington State has one of the most regressive tax systems in the US. What this video fails to address is the OVERWHELMING amounts of money that Amazon and Microsoft have put into influencing elections in that state\u2026 including vigorously attacking any and all forms of a wealth tax, which would allow the state to shift away from its regressive tax system. \r\n\r\nIts strange that this video is quick to identify a cause for real estate issues in California (even if they\u2019re fundamentally wrong), but oddly omits anything resembling a cause for Washington\u2019s regressive taxes.\r\n\r\n9:40 \u2013 Most of the district disparity in Illinois comes from heavy gerrymandering prior to becoming a Democratic majority. Add to that, there is still a powerfully strong lobbying force that keeps minorities in poorer schools and conservatives in the better funded schools. Again, no consideration of the underlying cause of the problem.\r\n\r\n11:20 \u2013 So, the game plan here is to just paint each state as entirely one monolithic political group without any sort of nuance whatsoever? No actual delving into any real underlying causes? No consideration of how the opposition parties may or may not have been an undermining impact in each state? I mean, this video is little more than a propaganda -driven narrative development piece.

Its a poorly developed hit-piece that is concern-trolling blue states.\n\r\n12:40 \u2013 For Democrats to \u2018embody their values\u2019 they need more than to control the state.

Regardless of how much compromise is made, a party will always tend farther toward the side that it leans toward.  The Democratic Party lacks the spine to commit to the ideas it proclaims because it would detriment those in power.  It doesn't actually support them.  The Republican Party may be evil, but the Democratic Party is stupid.",

Anything to avoid saying the system is extremely corrupted and Democrat politicians know the only thing they have to do is talk the talk and not walk the walk.  Explain me Sinema and Manchin (when Democrats can pass legislation without a single Republican vote).  And while you're there, also explain Obama's Romneycare when Democrats again controlled both houses of Congress.  What's fueling American Inequality are bought and paid for politicians who have no real interest in the system changing, and their media enablers who whenever anyone poses a real challenges to the neo-liberal system do their best to shove down our throats the best representatives of status quo politicians (aka NYT endorses H. Clinton for the \"Democratic\" nomination).",
