Sure, America is terribly designed for a person or bike, but it is great for drivers.  This point is brought up, but the basis of America is transportation by car.  Many of the large cities in America are designed to hold not just its residents, but those from surrounding suburbs and rural areas that come in for work or services only found in the city.  Public transportation into the cities from the outside are lacking because America\u2019s population is so spread out.  In Europe, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not problem to find public transportation when things are so close together, but even in the state of Illinois, the biggest city Chicago is 4-5 hours away from the state capital by car, and that\u2019s really the only way to get there.  In several cases, major cities in America are built on shaky foundations.  Above ground parking is the best way for us to accommodate the massive amounts of traffic to the cities since strong foundations are required to prevent some cities from falling apart entirely.  It\u2019s fine to prefer the way European cities are designed for people, but to claim that American cities are poorly designed when they are clearly built for a different purpose is just plain ignorant.",

Implementing more intracity bus routes while repurposing parking lots as bus stations, for example. Either way, we can\u2019t keep going on like this, it\u2019s simply not sustainable.

With roads, population centers went in all directions.  Philadelphia actually has a metro population of 6.1 million.  People outside the city work in the city, that is why you need more parking spots.  <br><br>With population centers 360 around a city, there is no practical way to serve everyone.  Why would I walk 30 minutes to a station, take a 30 minute train ride to downtown, then walk another 30 minutes to my office, when I can drive in 35 minutes (or less).  <br><br>I used to live in a &quot;close&quot; suburb of Indianapolis.  It was 14 miles from my work downtown. I rode my bike to work a few times, but you have to avoid rain and cold.  Luckily, my work had a shower.  I can&#39;t see biking to work on hot day and not having a show.  Most work places don&#39;t have shower facilities.<br><br>Each mile of rail is extremely expensive in America.  Look at those pretty pictures of Amsterdam and imagine tearing down those buildings and installing an 8 lane highway.  Not only would it be expensive, but very unpopular with the residents.  The Amsterdam residents would say, why are we displacing these people and spending all of this money on a system no one will use.   Exactly.<br><br>One day, all of these parking spots will come in handy when all cars are electric, and autonomous.  Cars will be a service which will be summoned when needed.  These cars will need a place to park when not in use.<br><br>America also has something some European countries lack, which is land.   When traffic or other situations get bad, people move.   The state of Idaho (congrats if you have ever heard of it, props if you can find it on a map) had a population increase of 6% over the past 10 years due largely to people moving out of California, Washington and other states. So you start to plan public transportation on population centers.... then the population centers move.<br><br>I don&#39;t disagree with you.  American public transportation sucks.  I used the Euro train system in Italy and loved it.  But I did not appreciate the condescending tone that there are &quot;easy&quot; fixes to American transportation.  This is not an &quot;easy&quot; problem.  Honestly, I would rather have universal healthcare over a rail system, but that is another depressing topic for another time.",
  "textOriginal":"Europe expanded on already existing rails.  At a critical juncture, American expanded roads and not rails.  Europe built population centers around public transportation.  With roads, population centers went in all directions.  Philadelphia actually has a metro population of 6.1 million.  People outside the city work in the city, that is why you need more parking spots.  \n\nWith population centers 360 around a city, there is no practical way to serve everyone.  Why would I walk 30 minutes to a station, take a 30 minute train ride to downtown, then walk another 30 minutes to my office, when I can drive in 35 minutes (or less).  \n\nI used to live in a \"close\" suburb of Indianapolis.  It was 14 miles from my work downtown. I rode my bike to work a few times, but you have to avoid rain and cold.  Luckily, my work had a shower.  I can't see biking to work on hot day and not having a show.  Most work places don't have shower facilities.\n\nEach mile of rail is extremely expensive in America.  Look at those pretty pictures of Amsterdam and imagine tearing down those buildings and installing an 8 lane highway.  Not only would it be expensive, but very unpopular with the residents.  The Amsterdam residents would say, why are we displacing these people and spending all of this money on a system no one will use.   Exactly.\n\nOne day, all of these parking spots will come in handy when all cars are electric, and autonomous.  Cars will be a service which will be summoned when needed.  These cars will need a place to park when not in use.\n\nAmerica also has something some European countries lack, which is land.   When traffic or other situations get bad, people move.   The state of Idaho (congrats if you have ever heard of it, props if you can find it on a map) had a population increase of 6% over the past 10 years due largely to people moving out of California, Washington and other states. So you start to plan public transportation on population centers.... then the population centers move.\n\nI don't disagree with you.  American public transportation sucks.  I used the Euro train system in Italy and loved it.  But I did not appreciate the condescending tone that there are \"easy\" fixes to American transportation.  This is not an \"easy\" problem.  Honestly, I would rather have universal healthcare over a rail system, but that is another depressing topic for another time.",

I am not a professional on the subject but I do have some ideas as to why this system works better for us, for one our economy is more capitalist than socialist (as well as our mindsets) so if an American can earn and do more with their earnings they are incentivized to do so. Americans will often live outside of a city to have a larger and less expensive living space then commute to work inside of a city to make a greater amount of money. If you asked an American if they&#39;d rather have the freedom of personal transportation or give up 10% more of their income so that we could have better personal transport I doubt very many would take the latter option. Then there is the matter of public transport, 19.32% of Americans live within the 100 most populated cities and the last on that list isn&#39;t even that large with a population of 208,916. All but the largest of cities will generally have very poor public transportation, in some cases one may need a vehicle or to take taxi rides just to reach a train or bus stop and at that point, why bother with the middleman (public transport). I feel that there is little obvious incentive for an American to speak out about improving public transport and public transport will remain an inferior choice if it does not improve; the &quot;problem&quot; perpetuates itself. The thing is that most Americans probably don&#39;t see this as a problem in the first place, and (I mean no disrespect by saying this, but) your identifying it as a problem may simply be a result of your European upbringing and the views you are more likely to possess as a result of that.",

So every child or young adult can go everywhere, without the need of a parent to drive. I would love to see German cities getting more car-centered, just like in the US. Another thing is that I don\u2019t feel safe walking around in some cities due to the people there or crazy bike drivers, while driving around in the car, I always feel safe and protected. I also don\u2019t care when driving takes longer than using public transport (for example in Berlin, it\u2019s often faster to use public transit), I hate public transit because it\u2019s always dirty and the people there are sometimes terrifying, so I still drive or use a taxi or Uber, no matter how long it takes.",
