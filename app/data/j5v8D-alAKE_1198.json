This is causing prices for new planes to skyrocket due to low production volumes, which intern is killing demand, which is then killing innovation.  No system is perfect but without a life expectancy the manufacturing volume required to innovate dies. This is why a circular economy is such a tempting idea.",

Now that $30 dollar motor is $600 because of the electronic and you can&#39;t just use any switch or any motor. If the technology become obsolete and you still want the option to function. You either need to learn how to diagnose and repair circuit boards or pay someone to do it. Or you have to entirely redesign it to work with new wiring and components like they used to or you are screw. And OMG if you start running into problems with the the signal voltage wiring. Technology, technological obsolescence and insane costs are forcing still good components to be thrown away or recycled a decade or more early. I bought a 1953 caterpillar grader.

And now the Brand spanky new stuff is real bad because many new heavy equipment manufacturers now use electronic play station like controllers to run major can&#39;t do without functions like steering. It&#39;s no longer just luxury accessories you can operate without. They are doing this to main absolutely essential operations that the equipment has to be able to accomplish to operate.
