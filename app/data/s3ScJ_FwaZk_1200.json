Northern part of Germany, for example, pays Denmark to take their power when it\u2019s windy, because Germany doesn\u2019t allow power companies to shut off wind turbines, while Denmark does. When there is extra wind in the region, Denmark shuts down many wind turbines, if they produce too much for other countries to buy, and gets money from Germany to take their power. This is because Germany\u2019s infrastructure doesn\u2019t allow the wind power from northern German to be transported to the lower parts of the country.",

  "textDisplay":"What we really need are HTSC (high temperature super conducting) HVDC (high voltage direct current) power lines snaking around the country moving huge amounts of power around.  These would be compact and in the ground because high temperature superconductors are awesome that way.  This would have the added advantage of it is easy enough to build in redundant loops so that it would be a very resilient grid.  When building at such scale to power the whole country, this is especially important.  When getting to these high power levels, these sorts of superconductors can carry over 150x the power of copper and not need any cooling.  While the issue is flipped to keeping the superconductors cold so they are operational, the energy loss as you scale to higher power levels grows slowly as in the cable with all of the insulation around it slowly gets a little thicker while the amount of power you can shove over the line grows dramatically and so quickly gets into the realm of economical when talking about huge amount of power.  Especially with HVDC you don&#39;t have to worry about skinning and you only need two conductors in a coaxial configuration and the job is done.  There is not even any external EMF in the coaxial configuration for the tin foil hat people to complain about.  You could bring a sensitive meter along to prove this point.<br><br>Another elephant in the room is green energy storage.  I think what we really need is to build a new 100 GW scale pumped hydro storage between the two Great Lakes of the largest height difference.  The reason for pumped is we are already basically turning off Niagra Falls at night in a one way system, so the only way to scale further is to do pumped hydro storage between massive lakes, basically a giant gravity battery.  The Bonneville Power Project could also be beefed up in the Northwest to be more of a peaker power system than a base-load while also basically eliminating the need for overflow channels when it is really rainy.  I mean stuff chemical batteries everywhere gets to be a big problem, but we already have ways to make big solutions, granted we can move the power around to do it.  At this battery buffers can alleviate the need for new power lines some by having a more continuous load over an existing power line as opposed to have it handle moment by moment load shifts and be designed for the peek power to flow through it, so chemical batteries are still quite useful even with massive scale gravity storage.",

When getting to these high power levels, these sorts of superconductors can carry over 150x the power of copper and not need any cooling.  While the issue is flipped to keeping the superconductors cold so they are operational, the energy loss as you scale to higher power levels grows slowly as in the cable with all of the insulation around it slowly gets a little thicker while the amount of power you can shove over the line grows dramatically and so quickly gets into the realm of economical when talking about huge amount of power.  Especially with HVDC you don't have to worry about skinning and you only need two conductors in a coaxial configuration and the job is done.  There is not even any external EMF in the coaxial configuration for the tin foil hat people to complain about.  You could bring a sensitive meter along to prove this point.\n\nAnother elephant in the room is green energy storage.  I think what we really need is to build a new 100 GW scale pumped hydro storage between the two Great Lakes of the largest height difference.  The reason for pumped is we are already basically turning off Niagra Falls at night in a one way system, so the only way to scale further is to do pumped hydro storage between massive lakes, basically a giant gravity battery.  The Bonneville Power Project could also be beefed up in the Northwest to be more of a peaker power system than a base-load while also basically eliminating the need for overflow channels when it is really rainy.  I mean stuff chemical batteries everywhere gets to be a big problem, but we already have ways to make big solutions, granted we can move the power around to do it.  At this battery buffers can alleviate the need for new power lines some by having a more continuous load over an existing power line as opposed to have it handle moment by moment load shifts and be designed for the peek power to flow through it, so chemical batteries are still quite useful even with massive scale gravity storage.",

Governments should be building 750kv 3 Phase AC lines at a minimum as they have a massive 120v capacity as energy cannot be destroyed only transferred. One step above this is to build 1.1 M volt DC lines as there is no skin effect losses and less voltage drop in general as electrons travel one way but the trade off is power transformers and DC\/AC rectifiers\/inverters of that size are hard to build\/transport. China already uses this technology. Currently 1.1 M volt DC lines go 4000kms between substations with current loads which honestly amazing. Most transmission lines of that voltage are 100-200FT in altitude and spaces vertically. What should happen is governments build renewable facility&#39;s in favorable remote areas and run those types of lines with multiple faculties reusing the same line with its capacity rating. Then Tie the lines into the nearest compatible substation using automated tie switches with alike system characteristics. The problem isn&#39;t the technology its the politics in the governments which is sad because they talk lots about climate change with no action when in reality they are just wasting more time while creating a more dire situation in the future.

That\u2019s a real world example of why having a power plant close to you is a good thing. \n\nLike investing, putting all your energy source eggs in one basket is ripe for disaster. A more reasonable goal would be to choose to add just a percentage of renewable energy sources that balances these factors. When you only focus on one goal, sustainable energy, you subsequently cross off all the other important goals on that list. \u201cRenewable\u201d energy is subject to the laws of physics, economics, and Mother Nature just like any \u201cnon-renewable\u201d energy resource. And \u201cConservation of energy shall not be violated!!\u201d \n\nTl;dr 100% renewables prioritizes only the goal of zero carbon emissions, it throws other important goals like reliability out the window. \n\nTrust me I\u2019m an (electrical) engineer",

  "textOriginal":"NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) spent 6 years examining this issue in detail.  They published the results of their studies, including solutions, in great detail, in the January 25, 2016 issue of Nature Climate Change.  The NOAA study rendered this VOX video completely obsolete in 2015.  AC power has too many inherent losses to solve this problem. NOAA concluded that we need underground high-voltage DC cables running along the right-of-ways of Interstate Highways and possibly some railway lines.  Cables adequate for doing this have already been developed by at least two very large companies capable of supplying the necessary HVDC underground cable.",

I felt renewables are the way but this vid highlights how much infrastructure needs to be built from scratch, the location sensitivity and the cost. Nuclear plants can just replace coal and gas plants, and hook up into the existing or a modestly expanded grid. They are also safe, Fukushima was built in a tsunami prone area so that doesn\u2019t count. There are also small modular designs that have come out. Nuclear while not perfect seems like a more actionable emissions free plan than 100% renewable. Not to mention solar panels and turbines have a shorter life span than a nuclear plant.",
