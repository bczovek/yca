Things like sticking to a sleep schedule and adjusting lighting, exercise, diet, and caffeine can all help shift your circadian rhythm forward and back as needed. A consistent schedule and lighting are often all you need to do it. Your rhythm is almost completely based on what you need it to be. Every teen, given there&#39;s nothing else preventing them from going to sleep sooner (such as homework or insomnia) can go to bed sooner and can adapt to doing so without a problem. <br><br>The real problem is how schools cause teens to go to bed later and disrupt their sleep cycle to the point their rhythm ends up so out of wack as it becomes a struggle to maintain a working schedule. It steals development social time from students and replaces it with homework and extracurricular activities. Schools often fail to provide students time to actually develop socially with those around them, leaving the only times to do so being if you can somehow squeeze it in during class or ignore your homework or other activities after school. Often times after school is filled with too much homework or required extracurricular activities and are often paired with educationally inadequate familial situations (in terms of pressure, as most families fall to either side of putting the right amount of pressure on school work, giving far too much or too little). On top of no social time, it provides little time to explore interests and leisure activities. Most students are left to somehow find time outside of school, which they often already lack, to explore potential hobbies and interests (which they are also typically expected to know by the time they&#39;re 16-18).<br><br>Tying into this lack of time, even if teens manage to get their duties out of the way in time to go to bed at 10, an interesting phenomena often called Revenge Bedtime Procrastination sets in, where people will happily sacrifice sleep for leisure time they failed to properly get during the day. As students tend to have little of this time, I would assert that they are more likely to attempt to stay up later to gain more of this time back at the cost of sleep - even if they don&#39;t realize this is why they&#39;re doing it.<br><br>If anything, the end times are more of a problem than the start times, as end times being further back in the day would and does cause students to lose even more of these precious evening hours. The evening is a time when students can still participate in the working and social world and explore their hobbies out of the home on their own time, pushing school further back into this time limits further what they can do socially and what they can explore. Time in the morning can&#39;t make up for this as most places are still getting going - and you&#39;re proposing they sleep through this morning time and waste it anyway.",

Often times after school is filled with too much homework or required extracurricular activities and are often paired with educationally inadequate familial situations (in terms of pressure, as most families fall to either side of putting the right amount of pressure on school work, giving far too much or too little). On top of no social time, it provides little time to explore interests and leisure activities. Most students are left to somehow find time outside of school, which they often already lack, to explore potential hobbies and interests (which they are also typically expected to know by the time they're 16-18).\n\nTying into this lack of time, even if teens manage to get their duties out of the way in time to go to bed at 10, an interesting phenomena often called Revenge Bedtime Procrastination sets in, where people will happily sacrifice sleep for leisure time they failed to properly get during the day. As students tend to have little of this time, I would assert that they are more likely to attempt to stay up later to gain more of this time back at the cost of sleep - even if they don't realize this is why they're doing it.\n\nIf anything, the end times are more of a problem than the start times, as end times being further back in the day would and does cause students to lose even more of these precious evening hours. The evening is a time when students can still participate in the working and social world and explore their hobbies out of the home on their own time, pushing school further back into this time limits further what they can do socially and what they can explore. Time in the morning can't make up for this as most places are still getting going - and you're proposing they sleep through this morning time and waste it anyway.",

For so long infact that I didn&#39;t even know I was legitimately depressed. I would have mental breakdowns on a daily basis, beating myself up in fits of anger at home and bursting into tears at the counselors office. It was horrible, I am so glad to never have to see the 4 walls of the tiny classroom I was holed up in every day for 2 years ever again. It brought me to the worst mental state that I&#39;d ever been in. The &quot;help&quot; they provided only made it worse, sending people to my home every few weeks at random to check up on me, the day I got my birthday present I was screaming and shouting at the top of my lungs in happiness because my Girlfriend got me a new graphics card. They were waiting outside knocking and they thought I had a mental episode. They didn&#39;t believe that I was genuinely just happy and so I was sent into a youth therapy program where I was forced to talk to people I didn&#39;t know about every little detail of my life. And while I still wasn&#39;t well in the head I had to lie and pretend that I was slowly recovering and getting better when in fact, being forced to go to therapy was just another unnecessary stress that lead me into some emotional episodes and fits of self harm. It is disgusting that the current state of schooling is at all considered acceptable and I hope my story sheds some light on the fact that change is necessary for the sake of all the other kids in the same situation I was in. It&#39;ll be okay, I want everyone in my situation to know that it will be okay in the end. As hard as it can be to see in those times of stress and anxiety, better days are to come and you shouldn&#39;t let school be too big a burden on your childhood. I attempted suicide multiple times as a kid and I&#39;m an idiot for doing so. There&#39;s a lot more to life and it&#39;s truly, deeply disgusting that for many, the first 18 years are nothing but torture on a daily basis.

I have ADHD and a few months after I began at my uni, I began to get chronically exhausted and stressed and have developed a tic disorder that really impacts my functionality even more. My school runs on a quarterly system, with 10 weeks equaling a quarter, and our materials are so intensive that every single student is stressed, exhausted, depressed, anxious, etc. I am not the only person w ADHD that has developed the same things from being at this Uni, which I find really disgusting that regardless of the major health impact these classes have had on us, the University only cares about money. The worst part is that once you start at this university, you can&#39;t leave because credits do not transfer, and what makes that even worse, is that the school does not make that a public notice before beginning there. It&#39;s a complete shock when you get there how incredibly rigorous and exhausting it is and then after about a year of studies, you finally find out that you cannot leave unless you want to start over again. So sad and we all tried to justify the actions, however, once COVID hit, the school would not lower tuition even though we were not using the utilities we were paying for, and with that, I believe everyone saw how much of a scam our University is. The worst part is that we are the most successful and famous art school in the world, as we have campuses in Europe and one that recently closed down in China. Parents send their kids to study here and so many high schoolers say that it&#39;s their dream school. The part that makes me the most frustrated is how some of our professors will literally shorten our deadlines a few days before a presentation because &quot;sleep is important,&quot; so instead they want us to stay up all night for days straight to then turn in a project 6 hrs earlier because they believe it&#39;ll help when in reality, I know all students will agree that, NO IT DOES NOT. Then when we try to speak up, they love to say, &quot;Welcome to reality,&quot; as if that&#39;s a real reality. It is not and that has been PROVEN by every alumni who have said that our school could care less about us and that the workplace post-graduation is so much better and bosses are so much more understanding and helpful. Just to give yall a reference, our projects are full-on interior architectural projects that would be completed by an entire team within 1yr, however, we only get 10 weeks and we do it individually.

If you go to sleep at 11pm everyday and suddenly try to sleep at 10pm YES you wont sleep because you are used to going to bed at 11pm. It literally takes not even a week to get used to a new sleep schedule. If you want to stay up late that is 100% your fault and your problem. Not the schools. On a different conversation... i think that phones and computers make us stay up later because before phones you just didnt have anything to do after dinner so you naturally went to sleep cause u were bored. Nowadays there is a lot to do at any time of the day. Thats the problem. Not schools. Im a student, i hate school like everyone else does, but blaming the schools for this is beyond me.",

I was actually having fun learning new things believe it or not. I was filled with excitement and thrill of learning new things, test my knowledge, get good grades, etc. I felt so good about it when I was younger and didn&#39;t care much about getting early. It feels sorrowful in a way whenever I have to look back at these memories...<br><br><br><br>Now I am demotivated, unhappy, sucked of all energy and interest, my creativity and way of expression totally crushed under the boulder of  school educating system, which is even more apparent during online school. While I liked it for the fact that it inspired me to follow my art passions of drawing, animating, writing, game and web developing; I didn&#39;t like it for the fact that it gives me practically no time to practice these things. You honestly won&#39;t believe how much pain it is to wake up in the morning, telling to yourself &quot;Alright today I am going to practice drawing and other stuff&quot; only to realize you&#39;ve been wasting your entire time studying and having no time to do all those things because of how fast time flies by.

  "textOriginal":"School genuinely made me feel like an office worker, doing grunt work every single day...But it used to be different back then. I was actually having fun learning new things believe it or not. I was filled with excitement and thrill of learning new things, test my knowledge, get good grades, etc. I felt so good about it when I was younger and didn't care much about getting early. It feels sorrowful in a way whenever I have to look back at these memories...\n\n\n\nNow I am demotivated, unhappy, sucked of all energy and interest, my creativity and way of expression totally crushed under the boulder of  school educating system, which is even more apparent during online school. While I liked it for the fact that it inspired me to follow my art passions of drawing, animating, writing, game and web developing; I didn't like it for the fact that it gives me practically no time to practice these things. You honestly won't believe how much pain it is to wake up in the morning, telling to yourself \"Alright today I am going to practice drawing and other stuff\" only to realize you've been wasting your entire time studying and having no time to do all those things because of how fast time flies by.
