  "textDisplay":"I get that the message of socialism needs to be spread in America. It would be nice if people actually knew what it entails instead of using it as pejorative.<br><br>I\u2019m living in Europe. In the US, everything is binary. So it\u2019s either capitalism OR socialism; third options are excluded. In Europe, we have a hundred in-between options. In South-East Asia it\u2019s even crazier: opposites can be combined. Yes, you can create social capitalism: corporations and the government working together to dramatically increase life standards for the common people. Some East-Asian countries have jumped from the third world to the first in merely two or three generations.<br><br>So my question is not whether capitalism or socialism is good or bad, my question is how to combine the good parts of both into something that works.<br><br>If you advocate socialism, you need to address the elephant in the room: it has been tried for the last hundred years in various countries and in general, more people have fled from socialist countries to capitalist countries than vice versa. I know people who visited Eastern Europe when it was still communistic. The reports vary from \u2018it\u2019s even worse than I thought\u2019 to \u2018I imagined it to be worse but I wouldn\u2019t go to live there\u2019.<br><br>True, there have been some successes in socialism. The Russians have reliable rocket technology and sure, Cuban doctors are top of the bill. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t see masses of people from all over the world migrating to Cuba.

  "textOriginal":"I get that the message of socialism needs to be spread in America. It would be nice if people actually knew what it entails instead of using it as pejorative.\n\nI\u2019m living in Europe. In the US, everything is binary. So it\u2019s either capitalism OR socialism; third options are excluded. In Europe, we have a hundred in-between options. In South-East Asia it\u2019s even crazier: opposites can be combined. Yes, you can create social capitalism: corporations and the government working together to dramatically increase life standards for the common people. Some East-Asian countries have jumped from the third world to the first in merely two or three generations.\n\nSo my question is not whether capitalism or socialism is good or bad, my question is how to combine the good parts of both into something that works.\n\nIf you advocate socialism, you need to address the elephant in the room: it has been tried for the last hundred years in various countries and in general, more people have fled from socialist countries to capitalist countries than vice versa. I know people who visited Eastern Europe when it was still communistic. The reports vary from \u2018it\u2019s even worse than I thought\u2019 to \u2018I imagined it to be worse but I wouldn\u2019t go to live there\u2019.\n\nTrue, there have been some successes in socialism. The Russians have reliable rocket technology and sure, Cuban doctors are top of the bill. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t see masses of people from all over the world migrating to Cuba. Why is that?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that socialism sucks. As a member of a labour (social-democratic) party, my thinking is closer to socialism than to the liberal right. But even the \u2018watered down\u2019 version of socialism is a hard sell. I don\u2019t think that this is due to a lack of understanding of people.

People will say that if you made that money, you should be able to do what you want with it. Why should you have to give your money away? My brother said that he got taxed so much for making more money that he might as well just not work as much.<br>Well, it&#39;s not really giving it away when that money helps better society, whether it be actually paying your workers enough to live comfortably, or paying your taxes so social services can work properly. If these billionaires did that, they&#39;d still be filthy rich, but the people below them and society as a whole would be much better off as a result.<br><br>I have the belief that if I came into money through work or luck, I would share that money with the people who deserve it or the people who are close to me.

  "textOriginal":"I got an ad during this video about how to make 6 figures a year. \ud83d\ude02\n\nYou really gotta think about wealth inequality. People will say that if you made that money, you should be able to do what you want with it. Why should you have to give your money away? My brother said that he got taxed so much for making more money that he might as well just not work as much.\nWell, it's not really giving it away when that money helps better society, whether it be actually paying your workers enough to live comfortably, or paying your taxes so social services can work properly. If these billionaires did that, they'd still be filthy rich, but the people below them and society as a whole would be much better off as a result.\n\nI have the belief that if I came into money through work or luck, I would share that money with the people who deserve it or the people who are close to me.

To try to further the fraud that the British are the continuation of the Biblical line of King David.  That is one of the reasons WW2 started.  To distract you from the fraud.  Women inherit men&#39;s last names, not the other way around.  Philip was a German, then he became a Greek citizen and then a British Royal.  He wasn&#39;t even a British citizen. (Search Queen Elizabeth wedding!)  People don&#39;t realize that Britain is part of the Roman Empire.  Prince Charles was just hugging the Pope recently, and congratulating him on his war.  The head of England is supposedly God&#39;s representative and defender of the faith.

The food itself?  The rent for the business?  The cost of water, electricity, and AC?  The toilet paper for the workers?  Who pays for all that? None of the workers.  The owner pays for that.  Who fixes the equipment when it breaks?  Who buys new equipment? How do they save for those unexpected emergencies when a water line breaks?  If workers always got exactly their worth in labor, the company and the owner would not grow in wealth, that is true, but the business would also cease to function.

  "textOriginal":"You are either a liar or ignorant.  Not once did you mention the cost of maintaining a business.  Where did the pizza oven come from?  The refrigerators for the food?  The food itself?  The rent for the business?  The cost of water, electricity, and AC?  The toilet paper for the workers?  Who pays for all that? None of the workers.  The owner pays for that.  Who fixes the equipment when it breaks?  Who buys new equipment? How do they save for those unexpected emergencies when a water line breaks?  If workers always got exactly their worth in labor, the company and the owner would not grow in wealth, that is true, but the business would also cease to function.

You are responsible for the choice of topic, the underlying research, the editing and all other admin and organizational aspects (that you don't outsource). The viewers are your workers: they put in the watching time and money behind the donations. It's thanks to them that anything happens. This can also be reinterpreted in other terms: if your channel is about bringing change in the society for the better, the people that actually bring that change are the true value creators. So isn't about time that we get rid of these \"billionaires\",  and you share all your profits with others? Why are you instead asking for more money to be moved from the pockets of others to yours? After all, you have never stepped foot in the premises where policy making happens; policies that could actually bring a positive change. Imagine a future where all the viewers make the ad revenue, and not the creators. Plus, you probably have no talent whatsoever and all your success can be explained by the socio-economic situation of your parents, and the exploitation of people watching Youtube.",

I would LOVE to earn what I put out in the kitchen, but if the business doesn&#39;t pull in overhead then the business won&#39;t stand. I think a more accurate way to analyze the situation would be to understand that most businesses take advantage of this amount and what should be balanced is the amount of profit put towards the wages of the employees. That the extra profit gets put back into the company instead of being funneled to the fat cat on top who already is making more money than God. But even still, there has to be amount of overhead that will keep the company running and the employees employed.",

But I think that all of this just adds to my point - you're picking on him just because he's the 2nd richest person on the planet, while there are much less richer billionaires and multi-millionaires who lead exorbitant and wasteful lives, hoarding money for themselves, rather than putting them where their mouths are like Elon does.\nThe worst part is that as always, you are absolutely right about everything in your video. It's a real shame to me you always tend to put a spoon of shit in your barrel of honey like this. When will people learn to look past their dogmatic beliefs? You even show that you're capable of that - you clearly ignore the part of Marx's work that is explicitly antisemitic and violent, while focusing on the good. Why can't you do the same for non-socialists?",

  "textOriginal":"The Ohio Pizza example is a little disingenuous, no money saved for rent or future ingredients or maintenance or anything else. Restaurants have to operate on razor thin margins as it is. That and they relied on a boost in sales over the cause and had people tipping $100. That's not something to build a cause on. However, it kinda proves the point. Workers and small business's shouldn't have to rely on donations and charity to be able to live comfortably. And maybe if the biggest employeers and exploiters paid a proper wage, that increased buying power would trickle out and more people would be able to spend money at the local pizza place regularly.",
