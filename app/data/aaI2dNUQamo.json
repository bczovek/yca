When u train muscles without the variety of movements and only with small amount of sets and (heavy) repetitions no real power will develop from that.", "authorDisplayName": "Ignatzius Turret", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTwq4IPwnmFRIVCMGhtLUVPX1XbbFsFqpWICw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg2ef8YuabDmv3TNkM-LpFA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg2ef8YuabDmv3TNkM-LpFA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2021-06-16T12:03:13Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-16T12:03:13Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "Strength!", "textOriginal": "Strength!", "authorDisplayName": "Jason Eel", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/uKu2xEhxlHpCHPjPmYICK_88jLMT8tQwPi8pp-lm-OvBBSnip9KXGLoQvFKd-7bfhHZWHHXF-Co=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCZkauGRMurfZ8SfBm8on5Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCZkauGRMurfZ8SfBm8on5Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2021-06-16T09:27:51Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-16T09:27:51Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "Exactly..that&#39;s My concept also..new sub I am..", "textOriginal": "Exactly..that's My concept also..new sub I am..", "authorDisplayName": "Glenn Timmons", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQKbD-Z19wRZHnYmCg3KQrSw04ze4819yPLLw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHuL0r1SDWwTZEvpEdDVgoA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHuL0r1SDWwTZEvpEdDVgoA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2021-06-16T04:02:43Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-16T04:02:43Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "The &quot;punch&quot; sound at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaI2dNUQamo&amp;t=5m25s\">5:25</a> totally shat me up as I thought his back had cracked from the squat... as always though a fantastic video Bioneer with lots of science involved.", "textOriginal": "The \"punch\" sound at 5:25 totally shat me up as I thought his back had cracked from the squat... as always though a fantastic video Bioneer with lots of science involved.", "authorDisplayName": "James Wilkes", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQBlU9el0IHcIk5yTrS1nn5_ddQnHQTwGfyNt3N=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl-FdddXfkYGk1NE3VYPdVA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCl-FdddXfkYGk1NE3VYPdVA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2021-06-15T19:20:16Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-15T19:20:16Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "Wow so cool new subscriber here", "textOriginal": "Wow so cool new subscriber here", "authorDisplayName": "John Moreno", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSAGi4GdUyzK5JZeKvKlKM0CsrPyoHzmeyMVsFidQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5avjNtNCZ6gMcnHD8Gs8Ng", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5avjNtNCZ6gMcnHD8Gs8Ng"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2021-06-15T14:04:24Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-15T14:04:24Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaI2dNUQamo&amp;t=1m54s\">1:54</a> &#39;little girl behind door&#39; was like <br>Whats wrong happen with this man", "textOriginal": "1:54 'little girl behind door' was like \nWhats wrong happen with this man", "authorDisplayName": "fake buddy", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSU5stPRlCfbBFIC-JRIUneBAGDrwnmo2pIR3OGHw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC18leWHdvnZ6XS53_eMtYYw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC18leWHdvnZ6XS53_eMtYYw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2021-06-15T13:44:12Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-15T13:44:12Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "i liked this because one punch man", "textOriginal": "i liked this because one punch man", "authorDisplayName": "Pathum Madurasingha", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSWAWKos2xNApPIekeo1_JLVl8_2hdoifLEhLUD=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl_YHpz5ujK-D5VdpAl7m7Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCl_YHpz5ujK-D5VdpAl7m7Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2021-06-15T13:06:58Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-15T13:06:58Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "Actually I know a person who is like that a Slim when you look at him he looks like weak, . . .

It made total sense that a complete transformation into a stronger form of super saiyan would be a form that made you hulking mass of muscle, no the next level should be obviously a more condense and compact form that focus all that energy to make an even more stronger power in an optimal way.", "authorDisplayName": "codenamelj", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuddwAjSBTsf6wTgw2lqMfcfWnbrfx8UE6S2f-=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxY2TKDTrX6fPsvKBtqZ-Vg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxY2TKDTrX6fPsvKBtqZ-Vg"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2021-05-07T16:52:07Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-07T16:52:07Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "Short answer.

The sad truth is thanks to a diminished quality of life from coast-to-coast globally people have been living dying for the last hundred 50 years or so to a diminished quality of life resulting in the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested throughout the history of mankind.   This diminished quality of life is primarily do to dirty low-paying jobs that come from outdated power sources inferior materials poisonous toxic substances pesticides chemicals that never change their killing composition which means whether it is a solid liquid burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor is always going to be poisonous debilitating deadly to the body. At the same time polluting corrupting devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world.

In layman&#39;s terms  You cannot promote life by doing business with material, resources and substances that have been scientifically classified religiously verified as petrified death or worse which all stem from coal, oil, gas and the chemical industry.   It&#39;s not all gloom and doom.   For we have the man/woman power to offset maybe even fully compensate all the damage that has been caused from dirty low-paying jobs.  And that is with clean high paying jobs from coast-to-coast that improve upon and maintain the quality of our air water foods landscapes working living environment every day home products habitat ecosystem plus the lifestyle I mentioned.   The goal is to live in a manner   that allows each persons generation to naturally and gradually become stronger smarter healthier happier better off physically mentally financially possibly spiritually then the previous generation.   Sad to say even undergoes best case scenario circumstances there is still going to be a percentage of people who freely live and die having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential of the were first born with.               Now I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim to the way of living personally and professionally. I guarantee you never see  hear another body man/ woman in power persons of legal religious authority leaders ever freely validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. One reason they don&#39;t naturally instinctively have the best interest of the majority of the population&#39;s needs at Heart another reason could be they come from a breed of cowards  or have a lifestyle that suggests, confirms and validates them as being absent-minded frail body. Is quite possible   to be a combination of those two worst-case scenarios.   For one is genetic hereditary and the other is a generic learned behavior.   Either way it is physically mentally spiritually useless to freely live and die in such a low-quality manner. Especially if that ignorance, stupidity, weakness and desperation  stems from being soft, lazy, out of shape, over fed, undernourished, overworked and underpaid with the dirty low-paying job. S.R.F", "textOriginal": "Out of all the teachings one may learn here during  life is that martial arts is by far the most beneficial, for it can be applied to every other aspect naturally and effortlessly. Martial arts is the fastest and most efficient way for one to learn their bodies capabilities and limitations therefore                                                                being able to become physically fit, mentally sound and  spiritually balanced allowing them to express physical freedom. Which is key for one to start living up to the pleasure, potential and  responsibility of femininity and masculinity at this level of body awareness    one naturally actually has a self-control, discipline, loyalty, devotion, appreciation, respect, confidence and joyful determination to validate, confirm and signify that the are being true towards love honor and the creation of life.  If one makes a conscious choice to live in accordance to validating love to the degree I mentioned it allows the subconscious to systematically coincide with the soul spirit mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world in the most efficient way that is humanly possible. Thus yielding the best spiritual kickback for one's efforts accomplishments experiences.        Anything less is feebleminded physically inadequate and  submissive subservient which it doesn't get any worse than that living and dying in that mannerism. For when one lives and dies having neglected the physical freedom they have had available all throughout their life a results in them being recognized internally and externally for all eternity throughout existence as spiritually sexually suppressed. Case closed mercy forgiveness spiritual welfare are not changing those facts protecting carrying compensating any wining souls or spirits that are freely connected to a life that does not do its best to improve upon and maintain the quality of it. You might want to take that point to Heart  considering if life is not free why the hell would death be any cheaper it's not. So don't miss the deadline on becoming   physically fit mentally sound spiritually balanced being able to express physical freedom.  Obviously high sources of nutrition will greatly increase one's physical freedom + formal education maybe some hands-on experience with the most extreme situations nursing homes daycare centers critical care units birthing centers.

So try to become fitter in whatever way fits your style and work on your imbalances!\n\nAlso: although i really like dragonball n stuff, those animes are an adaptation of the real world under relaxed assumptions, so NO YOU CAN NOT draw realistic benefits from anime back to the real world, it simply does not work this way.", "authorDisplayName": "Khazar Rec", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ_JzZvUnmYpQtvroHUK5tC_a0GdzUe9g4I7t1m8A=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hYdctV2yTXP0cxYfvlTSg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1hYdctV2yTXP0cxYfvlTSg"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-08-27T17:35:54Z", "updatedAt": "2020-08-27T17:35:54Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "Amazing dedication", "textOriginal": "Amazing dedication", "authorDisplayName": "Fu Ziyan", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLThvQpwakFV6vnIBTaouAjdGrjak-DwswCqbg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-MwfEp_aeFN6dDmGeWndQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCR-MwfEp_aeFN6dDmGeWndQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-08-27T16:46:44Z", "updatedAt": "2020-08-27T16:46:44Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "can you do one for iron bone training ? , an indepth more look or probably john wick jason bourne training ? if possible", "textOriginal": "can you do one for iron bone training ? , an indepth more look or probably john wick jason bourne training ? if possible", "authorDisplayName": "ASMR BULLY", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ2AjrWWfhOlnFcyUfEbE8-Q7mLXxL5RnDv-krQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6XLKQd7i__2NkagRZ0gh2w", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6XLKQd7i__2NkagRZ0gh2w"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-08-27T14:43:17Z", "updatedAt": "2020-08-27T14:43:17Z"}, {"videoId": "aaI2dNUQamo", "textDisplay": "What kind of jeans do you wear in these workouts?

And even in the 1% of cases where it\u2019s not, the person with the bigger muscles still has more potential to be stronger over someone who has less muscle fibres, they just might not be using their muscles as efficiently as someone who is stronger but with smaller muscles. Likewise if that same strong person without much muscle gained more muscle, they would always become stronger than before. Muscles create/generate force for movement.
